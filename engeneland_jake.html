				<p class="padding">On June 1, 2020, Jake was introduced as a contestant in the CJ ENM and Big Hit Entertainment's reality survival show I-LAND. On September 18, 2020, he ranked 3rd place by global votes and became a member of the boy group ENHYPEN.</p>
				<p class="padding">Jake grew in popularity in the show, impressing both viewers and the judges themselves with his rapid improvement. During the first episode he performed poorly, was overwhelmed, and even missed the beginning of his part for the performance due to a microphone issue that flustered him. By the end, he had proven his capabilities as an idol and in work ethic and the judges thought he was ready to become an idol with more success and growth ahead. Jake is also one of the few members of ENHYPEN that speaks fluent English as he is Austrailian. He came to South Korea on his own in order to pursue his dream of becoming a K-pop idol.</p>
