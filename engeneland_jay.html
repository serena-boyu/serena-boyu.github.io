				<p class="padding">On June 2, 2020, Jay was introduced as a contestant in the CJ ENM and Big Hit Entertainment's reality survival show I-LAND. On September 18, 2020, he ranked 2nd place by global votes and became a member of the boy group ENHYPEN.</p>
				<p class="padding">Despite a rocky beginning on the show, Jay became one of the most loved trainees for his strong working ethic, relatable character, and comedic moments. When the remaining contestants on the show were given a chance to ask questions to BTS members (a internationally famous K-pop group under BigHit Music), Jay asked BTS' RM (real name: Kim Namjoon) how he could have less embarassing moments on scene. RM's response was simply that they are unavoidable and he should instead learn to embrace them, which Jay has since greatly improved on. His comedic moments warmed the audience's hearts, making him rank 2nd place for global votes by the end of the show.</p>
