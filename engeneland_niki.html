				<p class="padding">Nishimura Riki (西村リキ; born Dec 9, 2005), better known by his stage name Niki (니키; also stylized Ni-ki) is a Japanese singer and the youngest member (maknae) of the Kpop group ENHYPEN under Belift Lab formed through the survival show I-LAND.</p>
				<p class="padding">Despite being one of the youngest trainees on the show (and the youngest trainee that was able to debut in ENHYPEN), Niki showed great skill in dance, even shocking other trainees with how fast he was able to learn choreographies. At one point on the show, Jay remarked how stunned he was that Niki had learned the entire choregraphy in only 20 minutes. </p>
				<p class="padding">Before the show, Niki practiced dancing very often as his family owns a dance studio. His love for dance heavily inspired him to become a K-pop star, although this was quite difficult for him as Niki is Japanese and had to learn Korean as a result. Despite this downfall, he warmed the viewers with his personality and made many close friends with other trainees during the show's filming. Other trainees would even give him Korean lessons to help with his pronouciation.</p>
