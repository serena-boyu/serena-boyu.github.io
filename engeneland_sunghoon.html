				<p class="padding">On June 1, 2020, Sunghoon was introduced as a contestant in the CJ ENM and Big Hit Entertainment's reality survival show I-LAND. On September 18, 2020, he ranked 6th place by global votes and became a member of the boy group ENHYPEN.</p>
				<p class="padding">Before becoming a trainee, he was a figure skater who competed in various competitions. He won silver at the Asian Figure Skating Trophy twice, during different years, and participated in the Korea Figure Skating Championship in 2018. His previous experience in competitive figure skating have given him the nickname "Ice Prince" among fans.</p>
				<p class="padding">Sunghoon quickly established himself as one of the most skilled trainees in all areas. His strong work ethic meant he practiced to near perfection, and his ability to learn choreographies quickly helped him greatly on the show where trainees were only given 1 week to prepare for each performance. He is also commonly attributed to being the most handsome member of ENHYPEN.</p>
