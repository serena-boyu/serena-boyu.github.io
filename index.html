  <h1>About Enhypen</h1>
  <p>Enhypen (Korean: 엔하이픈; RR: Enhaipeun; Japanese: エンハイプン; Enhaipun), commonly stylized as ENHYPEN, is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab (or simply Belift), a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation. Formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land, the group is composed of seven members: Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Ni-ki. Enhypen debuted on November 30, 2020, with the extended play (EP) Border: Day One.</p>

  <h3>Pre-debut: I-Land</h3>
  <p>In March 2019, Belift was co-founded by South Korean entertainment agencies CJ E&M and Hybe Corporation, with plans of creating a new band in 2020. Auditions commenced the same month in Seoul, the United States, Taiwan, and Japan, among others, for male trainees born between 1997 and 2008. On May 8, 2020, television channel Mnet announced the survival competition series, I-Land, a joint venture of both companies that "follows the process of next generation K-pop artists being born". Enhypen was formed through I-Land, featuring 23 male trainees, some of whom were from Belift's auditions, while others transferred from Big Hit Music, formerly Big Hit Entertainment, all then had been training under Belift. The show was aired weekly on Mnet from June 26 to September 18, 2020, and distributed internationally through Hybe Labels' YouTube channel. The show was split into two parts. 12 contestants from the first part made it to the second part of the series. On the final episode of the show, seven members were selected out of the nine final contestants, with six being chosen by global ranking and the last member by the producer's choice. The debut line-up of the group with seven members, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki, was announced via live television broadcast of the finale.</p>
